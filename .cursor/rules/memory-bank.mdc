# Memory Bank Rules

This project uses a memory-bank system for persistent AI context across sessions.

## Required Reading Before Work

Before starting any non-trivial task, read these files in order:

1. `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Project overview, tech stack, constraints
2. `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Current task list (source of truth)
3. `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - What's currently being worked on

## Required Updates After Work

After completing significant work:

1. Update task status in `memory-bank/tasks.md`
2. Append progress entry to `memory-bank/progress.md` with timestamp
3. Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with next steps

## Scratch Pad

Use `memory-bank/scratch.md` for:
- Temporary thinking/reasoning
- Ideas that need more exploration
- Session-specific notes

This file can be truncated when too long.

## Task Management

- Add new tasks to `memory-bank/tasks.md` instead of ephemeral chat todos
- Use format: `- [ ] **T-NNN**: Task Title`
- Include: Status, Priority, Branch, Related issues, Notes
- Mark complete with date when done

## Decision Records

For significant architectural decisions:
- Create `memory-bank/decisions/adr-NNNN-title.md`
- Reference in code comments where relevant
