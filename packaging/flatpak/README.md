# Build and install locally
flatpak-builder --install --user build-dir io.github.slskd.slskdn.yml
```

#### Development Installation

```bash
# From source directory
flatpak-builder --install --user build-dir packaging/flatpak/io.github.slskd.slskdn.yml
```

## Usage

### Launch slskdN

```bash
# From applications menu
# Search for "slskdN" in your desktop environment

# Or from command line
flatpak run io.github.slskd.slskdn
```

### First-Time Setup

1. **Access Web UI**: Open http://localhost:5030 in your browser
2. **Create Account**: Set up an admin username and password
3. **Configure Soulseek**: Enter your Soulseek network credentials
4. **Set Up Shares**: Configure folders to share with other users
5. **Start Using**: Search for and download files!

## Configuration

### Data Locations

slskdN stores data in your home directory:

```
~/.config/slskdn/          # Configuration files
~/Documents/slskdn/shared/ # Files you're sharing
~/Downloads/slskdn/        # Downloaded files
~/.cache/slskdn/incomplete/ # Temporary download files
```

### Configuration File

The main configuration file is automatically created at:
```
~/.config/slskdn/slskd.yml
```

### Environment Variables

Override configuration using environment variables:

```bash
# Set custom web UI port
flatpak run --env=SLSKD_LISTEN_PORT=8080 io.github.slskd.slskdn

# Enable debug logging
flatpak run --env=SLSKD_LOG_LEVEL=debug io.github.slskd.slskdn

# Enable VPN features
flatpak run --env=SLSKD_PODCORE_ENABLED=true --env=SLSKD_MESH_ENABLED=true io.github.slskd.slskdn
```

### VPN Configuration

slskdN includes advanced VPN features for secure private networking:

#### Pod-Based VPN

Create encrypted tunnels between trusted peers:

```yaml
# In ~/.config/slskdn/slskd.yml
podcore:
  enabled: true
  peerId: ""  # Auto-generated unique identifier
```

#### Mesh Overlay Network

Enable decentralized peer discovery:

```yaml
mesh:
  enabled: true
  networkName: "my-private-network"
  networkPassword: "secure-password"
  peerId: ""  # Auto-generated
```

#### Anonymous Transports

Route traffic through privacy networks:

```yaml
transports:
  tor:
    enabled: true  # Route through Tor
  i2p:
    enabled: false  # Alternative: I2P network
  relay:
    enabled: false  # Use trusted relays
```

#### Privacy Layer

Protect against traffic analysis:

```yaml
privacy:
  enabled: true
  messagePadding: true    # Prevent size-based analysis
  timingObfuscation: true # Add random delays
  messageBatching: true   # Batch messages together
```

#### VPN Usage

The VPN features allow you to create secure, private networks between trusted peers:

1. **Enable VPN features** in the configuration file or environment variables
2. **Create or join a pod** through the web UI at Settings → Pods
3. **Configure VPN gateway** settings for pod-based tunneling
4. **Set up port forwarding** to access remote services securely
5. **Configure privacy layer** options for enhanced anonymity

VPN tunnels provide encrypted, authenticated connections allowing secure access to services without exposing them to the public internet.

### Flatpak Permissions

slskdN requests the following permissions:

- **Network**: Access to Soulseek network and web interface
- **File System**: Access to downloads, documents, and music directories
- **Graphics**: Hardware acceleration for web interface
- **Wayland/X11**: Display server access

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Web UI

```bash
# Check if slskdN is running
flatpak ps | grep slskdn

# Check logs
flatpak run --command=sh io.github.slskd.slskdn -c 'tail -f ~/.cache/slskdn/logs/*.log'
```

### Permission Issues

If you encounter file access issues:

```bash
# Override permissions for specific directories
flatpak override --filesystem=/path/to/your/music io.github.slskd.slskdn
```

### Port Conflicts

If port 5030 is already in use:

```bash
# Edit configuration file
nano ~/.config/slskdn/slskd.yml

# Change the port setting and restart
flatpak run io.github.slskd.slskdn
```

### Soulseek Connection Issues

1. Verify username/password are correct
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure port 2234 is not blocked
4. Try different Soulseek listen port in configuration
