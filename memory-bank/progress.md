### T-1303: FIND_VALUE Kademlia RPC (Gap Task - P1)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **STORE RPC**: Added distributed key-value caching with configurable TTL (default 1 hour)
  - **Enhanced FIND_VALUE**: Iterative resolution with local caching of discovered values
  - **DhtService**: High-level coordinator for DHT operations (store, find, routing)
  - **Replication Strategy**: STORE operation replicates values to k=20 closest nodes
  - **Automatic Caching**: Found values cached locally to improve subsequent lookups
  - **TTL Management**: Proper time-to-live handling for cached content
  - **MeshDhtClient Integration**: Updated to use distributed lookups when DhtService available
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to local-only operations when distributed DHT unavailable
- **Technical Notes**:
  - STORE operation: Store locally first, then replicate to k closest nodes via RPC
  - FIND_VALUE flow: Check local → Iterative node lookup → Return value or closest nodes
  - Local caching prevents redundant network lookups for popular content
  - TTL ensures stale data doesn't accumulate in the distributed cache
  - Error handling: Graceful degradation when individual nodes are unreachable
  - Performance: Parallel STORE operations to multiple nodes for fast replication
- **DHT Architecture**:
  - **DhtService**: Main API for DHT operations
  - **KademliaRpcClient**: Handles network RPC communication
  - **KademliaRoutingTable**: Maintains peer routing information
  - **IDhtClient**: Local key-value storage (InMemoryDhtClient)
  - **DhtMeshService**: RPC server handling incoming DHT requests

### T-1302: FIND_NODE Kademlia RPC (Gap Task - P1)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **DhtMeshService**: New mesh service implementing FIND_NODE, FIND_VALUE, and PING RPCs over ServiceCall/ServiceReply protocol
  - **KademliaRpcClient**: Client implementing iterative lookup algorithm with alpha=3 parallel requests
  - **FIND_NODE RPC**: Returns k=20 closest nodes to target ID based on XOR distance
  - **FIND_VALUE RPC**: Checks local storage first, falls back to node lookup if not found
  - **PING RPC**: Simple liveness check for ping-before-evict algorithm
  - **Service Registration**: Automatic registration during Application startup via IServiceProvider injection
  - **Protocol Integration**: Full integration with existing KademliaRoutingTable for node management
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Uses MessagePack-based ServiceCall/ServiceReply for RPC communication
  - Iterative lookup prevents infinite loops with MaxIterations=20 safeguard
  - Parallel requests (alpha=3) optimize lookup latency while respecting network limits
  - Automatic routing table updates when processing requests from other peers
  - Proper error handling and logging for all RPC operations

- **Technical Notes**:
  - Uses 160-bit SHA-1 style node IDs as specified in original Kademlia paper
  - Bucket splitting only occurs when the bucket contains nodes within the local node's range
  - Ping-before-evict prevents aggressive eviction of temporarily unreachable nodes
  - Thread-safe implementation with proper locking for concurrent access
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `InMemoryDhtClient` usage
- **Key Algorithm Components**:
  - `GetBucketIndex()`: Determines bucket placement based on XOR distance
  - `CanSplitBucket()`: Checks if bucket splitting is allowed
  - `SplitBucket()`: Redistributes nodes when bucket capacity is exceeded
  - `TouchAsync()`: Main insertion method with eviction logic

### T-1300: STUN NAT Detection (Gap Task - P1)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Modified `MeshStatsCollector.GetStatsAsync()` to actually perform NAT detection instead of returning cached Unknown

### CI/CD Infrastructure Overhaul

**Morning Session: Dev Build Fixes (5 cascading bugs fixed)**

1. **Package Version Hyphens (Bug #1)**: AUR/RPM/DEB all reject hyphens in version strings. Fixed by using `sed 's/-/./g'` (global) instead of `sed 's/-/./'` (first only). Version now converts correctly: `0.24.1-dev-20251209-215513` → `0.24.1.dev.20251209.215513`

2. **Integration Test Missing Reference (Bug #2)**: Docker builds failed with namespace errors. `slskd.Tests.Integration.csproj` was missing `<ProjectReference>` to main project. Fixed by adding the reference.

3. **Filename Pattern Mismatch (Bug #3)**: Packages job failed with "no assets match pattern". Downloaded `slskdn-dev-*-linux-x64.zip` but file was `slskdn-dev-linux-x64.zip` (no timestamp). Fixed by removing wildcard.

4. **RPM Build on Ubuntu (Bug #4)**: Packages job tried to build RPM on Ubuntu, which lacks Fedora build tools (`systemd-rpm-macros`). Fixed by removing RPM from packages job - COPR handles RPM builds natively on Fedora.

5. **PPA Version Hyphens (Bug #5)**: PPA rejected uploads as "Version older than archive" because `dpkg` treats hyphens as separators. Same fix as #1 - convert all hyphens to dots for Debian changelog.

**Additional Fixes**:
- **Yay Cache Gotcha**: AUR PKGBUILD updates weren't visible until cache cleared (`rm -rf ~/.cache/yay/package-name`)
- **Dev Build Naming**: Established convention for `dev-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format with documentation

**Afternoon Session: Runtime Bugs**

6. **Backfill 500 Error**: EF Core couldn't translate `DateTimeOffset` to `DateTime` comparison. Fixed by using `.UtcDateTime` for explicit conversion before querying.

7. **Scanner Detection Noise**: Port scanner was triggering on localhost/LAN traffic. Fixed by skipping `RecordConnection()` for all private IPs.

**Evening Session: Release Visibility**

8. **Timestamped Dev Releases**: Added creation of visible timestamped releases (e.g., `dev-20251209-222346`) in addition to hidden floating `dev` tag. Now visitors can find dev builds in the releases page without accidentally getting them from the homepage.

9. **README Auto-Update**: Added workflow step to update README.md with latest dev build links on every release.

### Documentation Updates

- **`adr-0001-known-gotchas.md`**: Added 6 new gotchas (version formats, project references, filename patterns, cross-distro builds, yay cache, EF Core translation)
- **`adr-0002-code-patterns.md`**: Updated dev build convention with comprehensive version conversion rules
- **`tasks.md`**: Updated with completed work
- **Cursor Memories**: Created 5 new memories for preventing bug recurrence

### Builds Pushed

- `dev-20251209-215513`: All 5 CI/CD fixes
- `dev-20251209-222346`: Backfill + scanner fixes

### Testing & Verification

- Upgraded kspls0 from old build (`0.24.1-dev.202512082233`) to latest (`0.24.1-dev-20251209-215541`)
- Verified DHT, mesh, and Soulseek connectivity working
- Confirmed backfill button now functional (was 500 error, now works)
- Verified scanner detection no longer spams logs with private IP warnings
