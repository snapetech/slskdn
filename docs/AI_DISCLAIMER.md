# AI-Assisted Workflow

Parts of this project were developed with the help of modern AI tooling, including Cursor and several leading large language models.

These tools were used to accelerate research, explore design options, and offload repetitive or tedious work (scaffolding, refactoring, documentation, and diagnostics). All architectural decisions, critical logic, and final changes were reviewed and integrated by a human maintainer, who remains fully responsible for the behavior and direction of the project.
