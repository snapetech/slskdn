## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Phase 12 - Database Poisoning Protection (Security)
**Priority**: P0 (Security Critical)  
**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (10/10 tasks)  
**Remaining**: None

**Why**: Security hardening - protects against malicious data injection
**Status**: All tasks implemented (Jan 2026)

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ T-1430: Ed25519 signature verification
- ✅ T-1431: PeerReputation integration
- ✅ T-1432: Rate limiting
- ✅ T-1433: Automatic quarantine
- ✅ T-1434: Proof-of-possession validation (ReqChunk/RespChunk, ShareBasedFlacKeyToPathResolver)
- ✅ T-1435: Cross-peer consensus (LookupHashAsync with ConsensusMinPeers/ConsensusMinAgreements)
- ✅ T-1436: Security metrics
- ✅ T-1437: Unit tests (12/12 passing)
- ✅ T-1438: Integration tests (5 tests)
- ✅ T-1439: Documentation (mesh-sync-security.md)

**See**: `docs/security/database-poisoning-tasks.md` and `docs/security/mesh-sync-security.md` for details.

### Option 2: Backlog Enhancements (Low Priority)
**Priority**: P2-P3  
**Status**: Most items verified complete, few partial items remain

**Remaining Items**:
- ✅ **T-1405**: Chunk reassignment logic - **COMPLETE** (Jan 2026)
- ✅ **T-1410**: Jobs API filtering/pagination/sorting - **COMPLETE** (Jan 2026)

**Why**: Nice-to-have enhancements, not critical
**Estimated**: 1-2 days each

---

### Option 3: New Feature Development
**Priority**: As prioritized by user  
**Status**: No active high-priority features

**Available Areas**:
- Multi-Swarm Phase 6+ features (see `memory-bank/multi-swarm-task-summary.md`)
- PodCore features (Phase 10)
- MediaCore features (Phase 9)
- MeshCore improvements (Phase 8)

---

### Option 4: Testing & Validation
**Priority**: P1 (Quality Assurance)  
**Status**: Tests passing, but could expand coverage

**Options**:
- Expand bridge proxy integration tests (currently skipped - need full instance)
- Add E2E tests for bridge with actual legacy clients
- Protocol format validation with real Soulseek clients
- Performance testing for bridge proxy server

**Why**: Ensure bridge works correctly with real clients
**Estimated**: 1-2 weeks

## 📊 Current State Summary

**Codebase Health**: ✅ **Excellent**
- All builds passing (0 errors)
- All unit tests passing (2430)
- All integration tests passing (190)
- All major phases complete (1-6, 6X, Phase 12)
- No critical bugs or security issues

**Future Work Documented**: ✅ **Complete** (2026-01-27)
- All remaining work items documented in `memory-bank/tasks.md` under "Future Work / Backlog"
- ~25-30 items across 5 categories (Testing, Multi-Swarm Phase 6+, Backlog, Future Domains, Polish)
- Priority breakdown: P1 (4 items), P2 (5-10 items), P3 (15-20 items)

**Recommendation**: 
1. **If security-focused**: ✅ Phase 12 complete - no security work needed
2. **If feature-focused**: Start Multi-Swarm Phase 6+ or new feature work as prioritized
3. **If quality-focused**: Expand testing coverage for bridge (P1 priority)
4. **If polish-focused**: Tackle backlog enhancements or UI improvements (P3 priority)
