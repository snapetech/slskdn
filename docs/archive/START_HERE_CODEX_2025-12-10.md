## 🆕 NEW: Phase 12 - Adversarial Resilience & Privacy Hardening

> **100 new tasks** for protecting users in adversarial environments (dissidents, journalists, activists).  
> **Design doc**: `docs/phase12-adversarial-resilience-design.md`  
> **All features OPTIONAL and DISABLED by default, configurable via WebGUI.**

### Phase 12 Quick Overview
- **12A**: Privacy Layer (padding, timing, batching) — hide message patterns
- **12B**: Anonymity Layer (Tor, I2P, relays) — hide IP addresses  
- **12C**: Obfuscated Transports (WebSocket, obfs4, Meek) — evade DPI
- **12D**: Native Onion Routing — build circuits within mesh
- **12E**: Censorship Resistance (bridges, domain fronting) — bypass firewalls
- **12F**: Plausible Deniability (hidden volumes, decoy pods) — legal protection
- **12G-H**: WebGUI integration, testing, documentation

## ✅ What's Already Done

**Phase 1 (T-300 to T-313)**: ✅ COMPLETE
- MusicBrainz integration
- Acoustic fingerprinting (Chromaprint)
- Album completion tracking
- MBID-aware multi-swarm

## 🎨 Example: Your First Task (T-400)

### Task: Implement Local Quality Scoring

**What you'll find in the doc**:

```csharp
// Exact type definition to create:
namespace slskd.Canonical
{
    public class AudioVariant
    {
        public string FileHash { get; set; }  // SHA256
        public string RecordingId { get; set; }  // MB Recording ID
        public string Codec { get; set; }
        public int? BitDepth { get; set; }
        // ... (20+ properties, all specified)
    }
}
```

**Your job**:
1. Create file: `src/slskd/Canonical/Models/AudioVariant.cs`
2. Copy the type definition (it's complete)
3. Create the database table (schema provided)
4. Implement `QualityScorer` (algorithm provided)
5. Write tests (scenarios provided)
6. Mark T-400 done in `memory-bank/tasks.md`

**Everything is specified. Just execute.**

## 🚨 When You Get Stuck

### 1. Re-read the Design Doc
Every question should be answered in the spec.

### 2. Check Related Implementations
Look at Phase 1 code for patterns:
- `src/slskd/Integrations/MusicBrainz/` (API clients)
- `src/slskd/Integrations/Chromaprint/` (Services)
- `src/slskd/HashDb/` (Database patterns)

### 3. Check Conventions
See: `.cursor/rules/slskdn-conventions.mdc`

### 4. Ask User
If truly stuck (should be rare - everything is specified).

## 🏆 The Big Picture

### You're Building:
A **next-generation P2P music network** that:
- Works with existing Soulseek today
- Survives without Soulseek tomorrow
- Makes every client smarter
- Extends benefits to legacy clients
- Remains fully decentralized

### The Vision:
```
Today:
  Your slskdn + Soulseek → Basic P2P

After Phase 2-5:
  Your slskdn + Soulseek + DHT + Overlay → Smart P2P
  (MBID-aware, quality-aware, fair, fast)

After Phase 6:
  Your slskdn + DHT + Overlay → Unstoppable P2P
  (Works without Soulseek, disaster-ready, mesh-powered)

After Phase 6X:
  Any client → Your bridge → Mesh
  (Entire ecosystem benefits)
```
