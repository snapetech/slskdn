## Core Development Rules

1. **NEVER include local file paths** (e.g., /home/keith/) in documentation
   - Always use relative paths from repo root (e.g., src/slskd/...)
   - Or use ~/Documents if referencing workspace
   - NO ABSOLUTE PATHS WITH USERNAMES

2. **NEVER dummy down tests to make them pass**
   - Fix the actual implementation issue
   - Don't reduce functionality
   - Don't adjust test expectations to match broken behavior
   - Tests exist to verify correctness - if a test fails, the CODE is wrong, not the test
   - Exception: If the test itself has a bug (wrong test data, incorrect assertions), then fix the TEST

3. **NEVER use stubs** - create tasks instead
   - No placeholder returns
   - No NotImplementedException
   - No // TODO comments without associated tasks
   - Either implement properly OR create a task in memory-bank/tasks.md

4. **ALWAYS use RELATIVE PATHS everywhere** - not just in docs
   - Commit messages: "Modified tests/slskd.Tests.Unit/Mesh/..." NOT "/home/keith/..."
   - Error messages: "Failed to load src/slskd/..." NOT absolute paths
   - Log messages: Use relative paths from repo root
   - Documentation: Always relative to repo root or use ~/Documents
   - NEVER expose username or local filesystem structure in ANY output
